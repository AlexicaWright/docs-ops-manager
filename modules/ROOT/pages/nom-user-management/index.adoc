= NOM user management
:description: This section describes the user management in Neo4j Ops Manager.

*User Management* allows creation and management of NOM users enabling persons who manage the Neo4j estate to be assigned appropriate access levels according to their role. 
The effective access levels of a NOM user are reflected in the NOM UI appropriately.

== Roles of NOM users

[%noheader]
|===
||

|NOM Admin
|Has access to all features of NOM for all DBMSs  and can administer NOM users, including creating other users that have the role *"NOM Admin"*.

|Administrator
|Has access to features of NOM as configured by NOM Admin.
Can not administer NOM users.
|===

[NOTE]
====
The default NOM user `admin` has the role *NOM Admin* and can therefore be used to create new NOM users (including other *Administrators*) and configure their access to NOM features.
====

== Scope of NOM users

NOM users can only be used to access the functionality of the NOM server.
They are not related to users of other systems (NOM persistence, monitored Neo4j DBMSs, operating systems etc). 

== NOM user administration tasks

The NOM user management is performed in the *Administrators* section of the NOM settings page.

=== Creating a user

Click on *"Create user"* button to open the sidebar containing the tabs *"User info"* and *"DBMS access control"*.
Fill in user details including specifying if role *"NOM Admin"* should be assigned to them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
New users will be automatically redirected to the password change page after the login.
====

image::nom-administrators-create-user.png[width=800]

If the new user will have the role *NOM Admin*, no further details must be specified.
Use the *"Create"* button to confirm user creation.

Access levels for global features can be set on the *"User info"* tab.
Access to the *"Agents"* page of the NOM settings area is currently only one global feature that requires explicit permission.
Applicable access levels are: *"No access"*, *"view"*, *"edit"*.

==== Assigning access levels on DBMS specific features

For users having the role *Administrator* (checkbox *NOM Admin* on the *"User info"* tab is *OFF*), access to every DBMS specific feature can be configured in the *"DBMS access control"* tab.

See the following table for permission description.

|===
|DBMS-specific feature |Access levels |Description

|*Status*
|View, edit
|Access to the *"Status"* page for assigned DBMS(s).

|*Security*
|No access, view, edit
|Access to the *"Security panel"* page for assigned DBMS(s).

|*Status*
|No access, view
|Access to the *"Logs"* page for assigned DBMS(s).

|*Upgrades*
|No access, View, edit
|Access to the *"Upgrade"* page for assigned DBMS(s).
|===

Permissions can be assigned explicitly or implicitly.
DBMS which have neither explicit nor implicit permissions assigned will not be visible in the NOM UI for the user being edited.

===== Explicit permissions

Explicit permissions are be assigned directly to DBMSs.
Every DBMS can be assigned its own set of permissions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the DBMS is renamed or migrated after being assigned explicit permissions, the permissions remain unchanged.
====

==== Implicit permissions (DBMS glob patterns)

Should the Neo4j deployment have many DBMSs, it can be efficient to implicitly assign DBMS-specific permissions to a set of DBMSs with a single line in the permission table.
This can be done by assigning permission a DBMS glob pattern.
During access control, the DBMS glob pattern is checked against the DBMS name.
If using DBMS glob patterns, it is recommended to set DBMSs names first.
This can be done in the NOM UI.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since implicit DBMS permissions are always calculated based on the _current_ DBMS name, renaming a DBMS can cause changes in its permissions.
====

The glob syntax used in NOM supports the following wildcards: `*`, `?` and `[...]`.
For a description of how these wildcards work see for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)#Syntax[this wikipedia article].

Glob patterns are created by using the "Assign DBMSs" pop-up and can be reused for several NOM users.
To verify the set of DBMSs that match the glob pattern, use the icon next to the glob pattern in the permission table.

[NOTE]
====
*Rules for multiple permissions on a DBMS:*

. If several glob patterns match a DBMS, the permissions of all the matching globs are combined in a way that for every feature the most restrictive access level is applied.
*Example*: for a user, a glob pattern `\*` defines access level "Edit" for the "Security" feature, whereas another glob pattern `*PROD*` defines access level "View" for the same feature.
User's resulting access level to the feature "Security" is "View", since it is more restrictive.
. If permissions are explicitly assigned to a DBMS, they always *as a whole* take precedence over permissions assigned to a glob pattern that matches this DBMS name.
This means that the permissions assigned to a glob pattern are *ignored* completely.
====

==== Duplicating permissions of another user

The function "Copy other's access" can be used in cases when several NOM users with similar permissions must be created.
It can be accessed by pressing the *"..."* button next to *"Assign DBMSs"* button.

image::nom-administrators-copy-others-access.png[width=800]

This function appends permissions of another user (selected in the popup) to the permissions of the current user. 
Permissions already assigned are not appended.

=== Modifying a user

Locate the user to be modified, and use the tabs *"User info"* and *"DBMS access control"* to modify user. 
All modifications performed are persisted when the *"Save"* button is clicked. 
Clicking *"Cancel"* removes the modifications.
This also applies to removing assigned DBMS or DBMS glob patterns from the table in *"DBMS access control"*.
Until being saved or cancelled, removed entries are marked visually (grayed out).

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the user's password is changed, they will be automatically redirected to the password change page after the login.
====

[NOTE]
====
A user with role *NOM Admin* cannot degrade their role to *Administrator*.
====

=== Removing a user

Locate the user to be removed, click it and press the "Remove user" button at the bottom of the sidebar.

[NOTE]
====
Users cannot remove themselves.
====

[NOTE]
====
Should user modification or removal result in DBMS globs patterns being unused (e.g. not referenced by other users), these globs are removed as well.
