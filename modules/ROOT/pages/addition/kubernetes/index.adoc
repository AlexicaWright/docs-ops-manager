Neo4j deployments in Kubernetes environment are supported through Helm charts. To monitor a Neo4j instance as a container in a Kubernetes environment, there are several options
with verying degrees of support for NOM agent. 

Having a transparent view of the host where the Neo4j instance is depployed is a functional requirement for NOM agent. This view includes the ability of NOM agent to monitor and collect information about host resources such as disk, memory and cpu. In environments like a Kubernetes cluster, process containment makes it difficult to get a view of actual resource usage. 

Nonetheless, there are few methods to setup a NOM agent to monitor a Neo4j instance inside a Kubernetes cluster albeit less transparent.
