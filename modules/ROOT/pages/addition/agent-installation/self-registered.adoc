= Self-registering agent
:description: this page describes NOM agent self-registering setup.

Agent self registration omits manually aquiring initial configuration from NOM UI as described in xref:./manual.adoc#register[Manually registering agent] and instead relies on additional agent configuration on Neo4j instance host to obtain initial configuration from NOM server either through mutual authentication or manual authorization of the agent from UI after installation.

A self-registering agent is useful in an automated environment such as a Kubernetes cluster of Neo4j instances where instances are dynamically created and managed.

[[configure]]
== Configuration for agent self registration with manual approval
Following are the required environment variables to be configured to enable self-registration of NOM agent:

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example

| `CONFIG_SERVER_GRPC_ADDRESS`
| Server GRPC Address
| server:9090

| `CONFIG_SERVER_HTTP_ADDRESS`
| Server HTTP address
| +++https://server:8080+++
|===

With only the above configuration, agent attempts to connect to NOM server for self-registration which results in agent going into *Standby mode* until authorized.

IMPORTANT: *Standby mode* - this describes the runtime state of a self registering agent which is not authorized yet to monitor an instance. In this mode agent keeps checking with NOM server for approval status at every preset time interval (__default 30 seconds__).

An agent in standby mode shows up in the list of agents in NOM UI. To enable the agent to continue it's normal execution, agent needs to be approved from NOM UI as shown below:

To approve the agent click on `...` agent action icon and click `Approve`:

An edit view to optionally update agent name or description will show as below:

NOTE: an unauthorized self-registering agent will have default name derived from it's host information. It's recommended to update this name or use the optional configuration described <<agent-meta-data,here>>.

Once the agent is approved, by optionally updating it's name and description, agent will receive initial configuration from NOM server which it persists on the instance host in a file named `nom-agent-config.yaml`.

WARNING: Location of where agent saves it's initial configuration must be of persistent type else agent needs to be reregistered.

Following optional configuration can be used to provide a persistent location for agent intial configuration:

[cols="<,<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example
| Default

| `CONFIG_AGENT_CONFIG_PATH`
| Peristent path to a file on Neo4j instance host
| "file://path/to/"
| by default agent tries to save initial configuration in path `NEO4J_CONF` if set or `conf` folder under `NEO4J_HOME` if set, else the file is saved under `.nom` folder in user home directory.
|===

Apart from above configuration, following optional configuration can be provided as agent meta data:

[[agent-meta-data]]
[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example

| `CONFIG_AGENT_NAME`
| Optional name for agent to easily differentiate among self-registered agents
| home-db-agent

| `CONFIG_AGENT_DESCRIPTION`
| Optional description for agent to easily differentiate among self-registered agents
| An agent to monitor home db
|===

== Configuration for agent self registration with mutual authentication
Following are the required environment variables to be configured to enable self-registration of NOM agent with mutual authentication:

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example

| `CONFIG_SERVER_GRPC_ADDRESS`
| Server GRPC Address
| server:9090

| `CONFIG_SERVER_HTTP_ADDRESS`
| Server HTTP address
| +++https://server:8080+++

| `CONFIG_CLIENT_CERT`
| PEM encoded Agent certificate for mutual TLS
| /path/to/a/pem/file`

| `CONFIG_CLIENT_KEY`
| PEM encoded Agent key for mutual TLS
| /path/to/a/pem/file`
|===

IMPORTANT: *In addition to above configuration, NOM server also needs to be configured to trust the agent certificates as described xref:/installation/server.adoc#config_ref[here]*

=== Self signed certificates for agent

[IMPORTANT]
====
Self-signed certificates are not recommended to be used in production environments.
For production environments, it is advisable to use a trusted certificate issuer.
This section outlines a practical way to generate a self-signed certificate for test and demo purposes.
====

The NOM agent contains a utility to generate a self-signed certificate suitable for your environment.

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
$> agent ssc --help

utility to generate self signed certificate for TEST purposes only

sample usage:

to generate a self signed certificate for 'localhost', which could either be
accessed through DNS names of 'localhost.localdomain' or 'my.custom.domain', or
with IP addresses of '127.0.0.1' or '192.168.100.5';

$> agent ssc -n localhost -o /tmp -p changeit \
   -d localhost.localdomain,my.custom.domain \
   -i 127.0.0.1,192.168.100.5

it creates /tmp/localhost.cer and /tmp/localhost.pfx files upon completion.

options (required options marked with *):
  -d, --dns=<dns>[,<dns>...]
                            list of dns names to use to access the
                              server, eg. --dns=localhost.localdomain,test.
                              local.domain
  -i, --ip=<ip>[,<ip>...]   list of IP addresses to use to access the
                              server, eg. --ip=127.0.0.1,192.168.100.55
* -n, --name=<name>         common name to use in generated certificate,
                              eg. --name=localhost
* -o, --output=<output>     target directory, eg. --output=.
* -p, --password=<password> password for generated PKCS12 file
  -h, --help                help
----

If you are generating a certificate for running the server on `localhost`, `localhost` is the primary name set as Subject Name field on the certificate and is also used as the name of generated files.
For the certificate to be identified as valid, it also needs to include alternative names used to access the server.
Assume there are also a number of virtual machines that access the server through IP addresses `192.168.10.1` and `172.16.10.1`.
Furthermore, a local DNS alias `nom.example.com` is set up for `localhost`.

In order to generate a self-signed certificate for the above example, execute the following command;

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent ssc -n localhost \
	-o ./certificates \
	-p changeit \
	-d nom.example.com \
	-i 192.168.10.1,172.16.10.1
----

It generates a key pair and a self-signed certificate and creates `localhost.cer` and `localhost.pfx` files inside `./certificates` directory.
`localhost.pfx` is assigned the password `changeit` which is provided to the command as an argument.

You can then use these two files to configure the server and agents for TLS encrypted communication.
