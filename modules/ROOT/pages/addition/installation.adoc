:description: This section describes the installation process for adding a managed DBMS to Neo4j Ops Manager.

= Installation process

Adding a DBMS in NOMâ€™s terminology means to enable the monitoring of every instance in the DBMS by installing a NOM agent on the instance host and configuring it appropriately.

[[register]]
== Register agent

* Before adding the DBMS for NOM monitoring, an agent needs to be registered with NOM server which provides server communication configuration for the agent.
* An agent can be registered with NOM server -
** from NOM UI
*** Creation of agent requires name and description for the agent
*** Once registered the configuration for agent to communicate with NOM server will be:
**** `CONFIG_SERVER_ADDRESS=<server-address>`
**** `CONFIG_TOKEN_URL=<token_url>`
**** `CONFIG_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID=<agent-id>`
**** `CONFIG_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET=<agent-client-secret>`
*** Save these configurations securely for later to configure the agent
* Check if the instance of DBMS to be monitored has a supported version.
Only Neo4j versions from 4.4 on are supported.
* Before installing the agent to monitor an instance of the DBMS, make sure that the instance is up and running.
You can check the status with `neo4j status` command
