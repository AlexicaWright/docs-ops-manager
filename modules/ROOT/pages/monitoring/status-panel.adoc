= Status panel
:description: This section describes the status panel of the Neo4j Ops Manager.

In the *Status panel* page there are three main tabs containing information about your DBMS.

== System topology

This tab offers a toplology view of the specified DBMS.
It is similar to the topology view in the home page, but provides more detail.
The image below shows a healthy Single instance monitored, with two databases, `neo4j` and `system`.

== Tabular view

This tab offers a tabular view of the DBMS.
It displays the data found if the Cypher procedure `SHOW DATABASES` is directly executed on the DBMS.
