:description: This section describes monitoring in Neo4j Ops Manager.

[[dashboards]]
== Dashboard

The dashboard page offers rich charts and tables with data related to your monitored DBMSs.
Currently three time windows are supported Live (30 minutes), 24 hours and 3 days worth of data.

The table in the *Host Metrics* tab and *Instance Metrics* tab includes static data for our DBMSs, like the cpu cores of our system (physical and logical) and memory.

Charts allow for zooming/panning by clicking and specifying the area of interest by dragging the cursor.
To reset zoom in the chart you can press double click inside the chart.

[[status-panel]]
== Status panel

In the *Status panel* page there are three main tabs containing information about your DBMS.

=== System topology

This tab offers a toplology view of the specified DBMS.
It is similar to the topology view in the home page, but provides more detail.
The image below shows a healthy Single instance monitored, with two databases, the `neo4j` and `system`.

=== Tabular view

This tab offers a tabular view of the DBMS.
It displays data that can be found if you directly execute the cypher procedure `SHOW DATABASES` on your DBMS.
