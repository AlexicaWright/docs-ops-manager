= Monitoring

[[dashboards]]
== Dashboards

The dashboard page offers rich charts and tables with data related to your monitored DBMSs.
Currently three time windows are supported Live (30 minutes), 24 hours and 3 days worth of data.

The table in the *Host Metrics* tab and *Instance Metrics* tab includes static data for our DBMSs, like the cpu cores of our system (physical and logical) and memory.

Charts allow for zooming/panning by clicking and specifying the area of interest by dragging the cursor.
To reset zoom in the chart you can press double click inside the chart.

[[status-panel]]
== Status panel

In the *Status panel* page there are three main tabs containing information about your DBMS.

=== System topology

As with the topology view in the home page, the panel includes information about the specified DBMS.
The image below shows a healthy Single instance monitored, with two databases, the `neo4j` and `system`.

Like the *Status panel* view, this is a database-first view of your system.

=== Tabular view

This tab offers a tabular view of the DBMS.
It serves data of our system that can be found if you execute directly to your DBMS the cypher procedure `SHOW DATABASES`.
