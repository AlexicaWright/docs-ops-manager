[[system-topology]]
== System topology

Below is a visual overview of your system.
In the example image, two systems are monitored, one is a *Cluster* and the other a *Single instance*.

The Single instance is *online*, which means that everything works as expected.

However, the Cluster instance has a status of *DBMS Down*, i.e. the system is not operating at the moment.
In case of an agent's failure, the *Instance Down* in the last nodes, displays the message *Agent Down*.

[[alerts]]
== Alerts

Home page alerts aggregates the alerts for your individual monitored systems.
The alerts generated for a cluster that stopped responding, as described above, is illustrated in the image below.

Location of the alert can help you understand the location of the problem so it can be resolved faster.
