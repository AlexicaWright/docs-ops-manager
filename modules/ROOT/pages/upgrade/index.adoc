:description: This section describes the upgrade process from an earlier version of NOM.
= Upgrading from an earlier version

[[server]]
== Upgrading server

[NOTE]
====
Before starting the upgrade process, it is recommended to back up your existing NOM installation folder.
====

[[server-version-notes]]
=== Version specific notes

==== 1.3
[IMPORTANT]
====

All metrics will be deleted as part of the migration that runs on upgrade to version 1.3.

This is due to a major change to the metric storage model making previous metrics incompatible with this version. 

====

==== 1.4 

[NOTE]
====

The initial startup of 1.4 after upgrade may take longer than usual especially if the persistence store contains a large amount of query log data.

This is due to additions to the query log model which require existing data to be migrated.
