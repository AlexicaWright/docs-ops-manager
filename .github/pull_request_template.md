If you open a PR that needs to go into a current version, you need to *cherry-pick your commit from dev over to the current version branch*. Only then will the proper builds that generate html/pdf be run. But beware: Docs will be generated but not published automatically!

- [ ] N/A - or - I have added the appropriate "cherry-pick-to" labels to this PR so I don't forget to do this later!
